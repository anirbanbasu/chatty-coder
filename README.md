The **chatty-coder** is an agent-based human-in-the-loop computer program code generator. It is based on the idea introduced in the 2024 paper _Can Language Models Solve Olympiad Programming?_[^1], which uses a combination of _self-reflection_ and _retrieval over episodic knowledge_ with _human-in-the-loop_ collaboration to improve code generation responses of language models to coding challenges from the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO). The chatty-coder closely resembles the experimental LangGraph based implementation of the paper called [Competitive Programming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/usaco/usaco/) with a Gradio based user interface.
